# Virtual File System
#### A virtual file system made to work with Udon in VRChat. The file system data can be imported/exported as a string. This means you can carry the string with you to another instance, or save it somewhere offline (eg. Notepad) for later use.

_NOTE: This repo is only for scripting reference. It only contains the csharp code files from the VFS package. This is not the whole VFS package. The VFS package contains other files (*.unity, *.mat, *.prefab, etc.). To download the whole VFS package visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Demkeys/VirtualFileSystem/releases) page. Since this repo is for reference only, I won't be accepting any Pull Requests. If there are any bugs to report you can report them in Issues._

There will be a Wiki for the documentation but for now, the documentation can be found on the [Manual](https://github.com/Demkeys/VirtualFileSystem/blob/main/Manual.md) page.

### TODO:
* Create Wiki containing all the VFS documentation.
* Maybe add a file containing helper methods to convert certain data types to bytes and vice versa. That file is mainly gonna be part of the repo, not the package. People can copy the code for functions that they need.
* Check FileManager and FileSystem for unused variables and delete them.
