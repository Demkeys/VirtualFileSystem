# VirtualFileSystem
 A virtual file system made to work with Udon in VRChat.
 
___NOTE: This repo only contains the csharp code files from the VFS package. This is meant to be used as a scripting reference. This is not the whole VFS package. There are other files form the VFS package (*.unity, *.mat, *.prefab, etc.) that are not show in this repo, but will be present in the VFS package. To download the whole VFS package visit the Releases page.___

### TODO:
* Add more comments to FileManager and FileSystem. FileSystem's DecompressFileSystemData method might need more comments.
* Create Ex03 example scene to demonstrate a very basic data integrity check.
