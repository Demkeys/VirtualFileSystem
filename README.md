# VirtualFileSystem
 A virtual file system made to work with Udon in VRChat.
 This repo only contains the csharp code files from the VFS package. This is meant to be used as a scripting reference. This is not the whole VFS package. To download the whole VFS package visit the Releases page.

### TODO:
* Add more comments to FileManager and FileSystem. FileSystem's DecompressFileSystemData method might need more commenting.
