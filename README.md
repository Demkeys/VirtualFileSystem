# VirtualFileSystem
#### A virtual file system made to work with Udon in VRChat. The file system data can be imported/exported as a string. This means you can carry the string with you to another instance, or save it somewhere offline (eg. Notepad) for later use.
 
_NOTE: This repo only contains the csharp code files from the VFS package. This is meant to be used as a scripting reference. This is not the whole VFS package. There are other files from the VFS package (*.unity, *.mat, *.prefab, etc.) that are not present in this repo, but will be present in the VFS package. To download the whole VFS package visit the Releases page._

### TODO:
* Add more comments to FileManager and FileSystem. FileSystem's DecompressFileSystemData method might need more comments.
* Create Ex03 example scene to demonstrate a very basic data integrity check.
* Create Wiki containing all the VFS documentation.
